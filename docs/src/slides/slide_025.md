##### Product Offers Table

Sequel-Mart wants to **start offering discount campaigns**

We want to be able to:
- Give our offer an ID and a name (these must have values)
- Discount a range of products by between 0.01% and 99.99%
    - <span>We need to provide a link to the `Products` table</span>
- The offer should be open for a given time range in days

For example our first planned offer is:
- ID 1, with the name of 'Introductory Discount'
- This offer involves discounting our broad beans (product ID 65) by 5.5%
- The discount is applicable between 1st September 2021 and 30th September 2021

This specification might produce a table design like this:

```
CREATE TABLE "sequel-mart-schema"."Product_Offers" (
	offer_id INT NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
	offer_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'To Be Announced',
	product_id INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
	offer_discount_percentage numeric(4,2),
	offer_start_date date,
	offer_end_date date
);
```

Make sure the schema is included in the name or it will be created in the 'Public' schema

If we run this script in a Query Tool Window, we should get:
- A message logging that a `CREATE TABLE` script was run
- A message logging whether it was successful
- How long it took to create if it was successful

Now if we right-click on the table list and click 'Refresh' the new table should appear
